; Ring Out - Ver 1.0 : Windows installer (Inno Setup)
;
; Built by .github/scripts/package-windows.ps1 on the CI runner.
;
; PrivilegesRequired=lowest is deliberate and load-bearing. Ring Out recompiles
; the game from the user's own disc INTO ITS OWN FOLDER -- setup.ps1 writes
; game/, work/ and bin/g<ID>_recomp.dll there, and the runtime writes userdata/.
; A machine-wide install under Program Files is read-only for a normal user, so
; first-run setup would fail. "lowest" resolves {autopf} to the per-user
; Programs folder, which is writable.

WelcomeLabel2=This will install {#AppName} {#AppVersion} on your computer.%n%nNo game data is included. After installing, you supply a GameCube disc image you already own, and it is extracted and recompiled on this machine -- that step takes several minutes and needs about 1.5 GB of free space.
