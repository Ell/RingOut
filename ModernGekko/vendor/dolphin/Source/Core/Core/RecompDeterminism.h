// The harness has always run with no input at all, which makes its determinism
// claim much weaker than it looks: netplay desyncs on gameplay, not on a title
// screen that nothing is driving. Feeding both runs the same inputs is what
// actually tests the thing netplay depends on.
//
// Keyed on the frame, not on wall-clock time, and that distinction is the whole
// point. Writing presses into Dolphin's Pipe input device works for driving the
// game by hand, but which emulated frame a press lands on then depends on host
// timing -- so two runs would receive different input and diverge for a reason
// that says nothing about the core. Frame-keyed playback is reproducible by
// construction.
